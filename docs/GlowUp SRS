## 3. Non‑Functional Requirements (make them measurable)
- **Performance:** The system should load main pages within 3 seconds under normal internet conditions.
- **Availability/Reliability:** The application should be available at least 99% of the time during the semester demonstration period.
- **Security/Privacy:** User accounts must require secure login authentication, and sensitive information such as passwords must not be stored in plain text. No real payment information will be stored in this prototype.
- **Usability:** The interface should be easy to navigate, readable on mobile and desktop devices, and provide clear buttons and labels for booking services.

---

## 4. Assumptions, Constraints, and Policies
- The system is a semester project prototype and will not include full production-level features.
- Real payment processing will not be implemented; payments are simulated only.
- Users must create an account before booking or reviewing services.
- Service providers are responsible for managing their own availability and service details.
- The project must follow UNCG academic integrity policies and appropriate content guidelines.
- Development is limited to the technologies required in CSC 340 (Java, REST API, PostgreSQL, and web interface).
---

## 5. Milestones (course‑aligned)
- **M2 Requirements** — this file + stories opened as issues. 
- **M3 High‑fidelity prototype** — core customer/provider flows fully interactive.
