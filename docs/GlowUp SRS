## 2. Functional Requirements (User Stories)
Write each story as: **As a `<role>`, I want `<capability>`, so that `<benefit>`.** Each story includes at least one **Given/When/Then** scenario.

### 2.1 Customer Stories
- **US‑CUST‑001 — <short title>**  
  _Story:_ As a customer, I want … so that …  
  _Acceptance:_
  ```gherkin
  Scenario: <happy path>
    Given <preconditions>
    When  <action>
    Then  <observable outcome>
  ```

- **US‑CUST‑002 — <Book a service appointment>**  
  _Story:_ As a customer, I want to book an available time slot with a provider, so that I can receive a beauty or grooming service at a convenient time.
  _Acceptance:_
  ```gherkin
  Scenario: Successful booking
  Given the customer is logged into the system
  When the customer selects a provider and chooses an available time slot
  Then the appointment is saved and confirmed for that customer
  ```

### 2.2 Provider Stories
- **US‑PROV‑001 — <short title>**  
  _Story:_ As a provider, I want … so that …  
  _Acceptance:_
  ```gherkin
  Scenario: <happy path>
    Given <preconditions>
    When  <action>
    Then  <observable outcome>
  ```

- **US‑PROV‑002 — <Manage service availability>**  
  _Story:_ As a provider, I want to set and update my available time slots, so that customers can book appointments only during times I am available.
  _Acceptance:_
  ```gherkin
  Scenario: Update availability
  Given the provider is logged into their account
  When the provider adds or edits available time slots
  Then the updated availability is visible to customers searching for services
  ```

### 2.3 SysAdmin Stories
- **US‑ADMIN‑001 — <short title>**  
  _Story:_ As a sysadmin, I want … so that …  
  _Acceptance:_
  ```gherkin
  Scenario: <happy path>
    Given <preconditions>
    When  <action>
    Then  <observable outcome>
  ```

- **US‑ADMIN‑002 — <Moderate user reviews>**  
  _Story:_ As a system administrator, I want to review and remove inappropriate customer reviews, so that the platform remains safe and respectful for all users
  _Acceptance:_
  ```gherkin
  Scenario: Remove inappropriate review
  Given the administrator is logged into the admin dashboard
  When the administrator selects a review that violates guidelines and removes it
  Then the review is no longer visible on the platform
  ```

## 3. Non‑Functional Requirements (make them measurable)
- **Performance:** The system should load main pages within 3 seconds under normal internet conditions.
- **Availability/Reliability:** The application should be available at least 99% of the time during the semester demonstration period.
- **Security/Privacy:** User accounts must require secure login authentication, and sensitive information such as passwords must not be stored in plain text. No real payment information will be stored in this prototype.
- **Usability:** The interface should be easy to navigate, readable on mobile and desktop devices, and provide clear buttons and labels for booking services.

---

## 4. Assumptions, Constraints, and Policies
- The system is a semester project prototype and will not include full production-level features.
- Real payment processing will not be implemented; payments are simulated only.
- Users must create an account before booking or reviewing services.
- Service providers are responsible for managing their own availability and service details.
- The project must follow UNCG academic integrity policies and appropriate content guidelines.
- Development is limited to the technologies required in CSC 340 (Java, REST API, PostgreSQL, and web interface).

## 5. Milestones (course‑aligned)
- **M2 Requirements** — this file + stories opened as issues. 
- **M3 High‑fidelity prototype** — core customer/provider flows fully interactive. 
- **M4 Design** — architecture, schema, API outline. 
- **M5 Backend API** — key endpoints + tests. 
- **M6 Increment** — ≥2 use cases end‑to‑end. 
- **M7 Final** — complete system & documentation.

## 6. Change Management
- Stories are living artifacts; changes are tracked via repository issues and linked pull requests.  
- Major changes should update this SRS.
