## About Me 
Hello my name is Keile, I am currently in my final year here at UNCG to which I will be graduating hopefully next semester in the fall. A reason why I went into Computer Science is because I love challenging myself and also being able to create code from scratch. One fact about me is that I really love films and I suppose my favorite film at the moment would be Sinners. 

## My CSC 340 Goals
My current goal for CSC 340 is that I want to have a complete understanding on how to create either an app or website. I myself have have created a personal webpage using html but I've never really used other languages such as C++ or C so hopefully for this class I can get a better grasp at them.
